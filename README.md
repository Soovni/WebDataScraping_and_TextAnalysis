## WebDataScraping_and_TextAnalysis_project 
"Web Data Scraping and Text Analysis" is a project conducted in a capstone design course. After learning web crawling, we extract text information from the collected data, perform sentiment analysis, apply machine learning, and ultimately derive improvement suggestions from a business management perspective.

### Project contents

The analysis identified the strengths and weaknesses of major real estate apps through user reviews. 
다방 excels in filtering features, 직방 is strong in information management, and 피터팬 offers direct transactions without brokerage fees. 
In contrast, 네이버부동산 faces challenges with functionality and UX issues. 
Topic and sentiment analysis highlighted areas for improvement, including enhancing management systems for 다방 and strengthening fraud reporting for 피터팬.
A positioning map revealed that 다방 leads in user experience, while 네이버부동산 requires significant improvements in functionality and information management.

### Project objectives
This study aims to analyze user review data from major real estate platforms in the Prop-Tech market to identify unique differentiating features of each platform.
It will use text analysis techniques such as frequency analysis, word clouds, and network analysis, and explore the relationship between reviews and ratings through regression analysis. 
The study will also propose a personalized recommendation system for real estate apps based on platform characteristics and user data, with the goal of reducing the use of multiple apps and enhancing platform loyalty.

### Methods used
The study analyzed user reviews of real estate apps to identify strengths and weaknesses and conducted topic modeling and sentiment analysis. 
It calculates sentiment scores by applying keyword weights and normalizing them.
For rating prediction, TF-IDF vectorization and a Random Forest Regressor are used to predict review scores, 
with evaluation metrics like MSE and R² to assess model performance.

### Expectation and contribution
This study offers practical real estate app recommendations for beginners using user review data, 
introduces a text-based sentiment analysis and rating prediction method, and provides insights on platform differentiation and service improvements.
It also addresses the issue of false sales in the Prop-Tech market, which is frequently mentioned in user reviews, urging improvements in this area.

### Mentor’s opinions
The mentor suggests providing more detailed explanations, especially in network analysis; 
refining the weighted calculation method for strength-weakness analysis; conducting further statistical analysis for sentiment score calculations; and ensuring that vectorized word scores are continuous for accurate prediction.
